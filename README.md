# ShadowWarsII
Project 2 for SWEN20003: Object Oriented Software Development 2018 (Semester 1)

In this project, I created a graphical space shooter game in the Java programming language, continuing from my work in Project 1 ([ShadowWars](https://github.com/change-agent/ShadowWars)).
Shadow Wars is an action game where the player must defeat wave after wave of robotic enemies, culminating in an epic fight against the robot mother ship. The enemies appear in a set pattern, and increase the playerâ€™s score when they are defeated.

Due to family circumstances beyond my control, I was unable to devote as much time as I wanted to this project; therefore, some features are not fully implemented.
